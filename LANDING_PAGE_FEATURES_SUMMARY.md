## 🎨 Design Principles Used

### Visual Hierarchy
- **Large gradient icons** (h-14 w-14) with emoji for immediate recognition
- **Speed badges** (top-right corner) showing processing time
- **Bold headings** (text-2xl) for feature names
- **Descriptive subtitles** explaining core value

### Interactive Design
- **Hover effects**: Shadow lift + gradient border change
- **Group animations**: Using Tailwind's `group` classes
- **Gradient blurs**: Decorative background effects (absolute positioned)
- **Color coding**: Consistent theme per feature (blue/purple/orange/green)

### Responsive Layout
- **Grid system**: `lg:grid-cols-2` for 2x2 layout on desktop
- **Stacked on mobile**: Automatically stacks vertically on small screens
- **Consistent spacing**: `gap-8` between cards, `space-y-3` in lists
- **Proper padding**: `p-8` for card content

### Accessibility
- **Semantic HTML**: Proper heading hierarchy (h2 → h3 → h4)
- **Descriptive text**: Clear explanations for every feature
- **Visual indicators**: Checkmarks, badges, icons for quick scanning
- **Color contrast**: High contrast text on all backgrounds

3. **Photo OCR** = Snap receipt photo → AI reads it → Invoice created (8 sec)

4. **QR Code** = Customer pays → Gets receipt with QR → You scan → See ✅ PAID or ❌ UNPAID (2 sec)

### Why They Matter (Now Clearly Shown):
- **Voice/Text**: No typing, no calculating, no designing
- **Photo OCR**: No retyping receipts, no manual entry
- **QR Verification**: No trusting fake screenshots, instant proof
