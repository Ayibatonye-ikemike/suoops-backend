"""Invoice paid_at timestamp & receipt dispatch tests.

Focus:
1. Status transition to 'paid' sets timezone-aware paid_at (UTC) & generates receipt PDF.
2. Receipt notification helper invoked with expected email subject containing business name.

Implementation:
- In-memory SQLite keeps tests lightweight.
- Monkeypatch notification helper to capture arguments.
