"""Async tests for NotificationService facade (invoice + receipt).

These tests focus on verifying that the public composite methods
`send_invoice_notification` and `send_receipt_notification` orchestrate
channel calls and return an aggregate dict with the expected shape.

Network / provider calls are monkeypatched out so tests run quickly and
without external dependencies.
