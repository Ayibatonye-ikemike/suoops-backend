## Program Overview

### Purpose
Create a sustainable, scalable sales force by incentivizing both direct sales AND team building, without significantly impacting our Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC).

### Key Principles
- ✅ **Self-Funding:** Commissions come from subscription revenue
- ✅ **Performance-Based:** No sales = no commission
- ✅ **2-Level Cap:** Prevents pyramid scheme dynamics
- ✅ **Transparent:** Everyone knows exactly how they earn

### Cost Impact on Business
| Scenario | Total Commission | % of ₦5,000 Revenue |
|----------|------------------|---------------------|
| Solo Marketer | ₦500 | 10% |
| With L1 Supervisor | ₦550 | 11% |
| With L1 + L2 | ₦575 | 11.5% |

**We retain 88.5%+ of subscription revenue** ✅

**Example Earnings:**
- 10 subs/week × 4 weeks = 40 subs × ₦500 = ₦20,000 commission

## Roles & Requirements

### Role Definitions

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

│    Earns: L1 benefits + ₦25/sub-team sale               │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                      SUPERVISOR (L1)                    │
│    Requirements: 5+ active marketers, 5 own sales/wk    │
│    Earns: Own sales + ₦50/team sale + higher stipend    │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                    FIELD MARKETER (L0)                  │
│    Requirements: 10 subs/week minimum                   │

---

## Tracking System

### Primary Tracking: Referral Codes (Automatic) ⭐

**Each marketer uses their SuoOps referral code for all sales.**

```
HOW IT WORKS:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 1. Marketer creates SuoOps account                  │
│ 2. Gets unique referral code (e.g., REF-ABC123)     │
│ 3. When signing up customers, they enter the code   │
│ 4. System automatically tracks the referral         │
│ 5. When customer goes Pro → ₦500 auto-credited      │
│ 6. Shows in Referral Dashboard instantly            │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Why This is Better:**
- ✅ **Automatic** - No manual reporting needed
- ✅ **Accurate** - System is source of truth
- ✅ **No disputes** - Customer entered the code themselves
- ✅ **Less VA work** - Just check dashboard
- ✅ **Instant tracking** - Real-time visibility

### Marketer Onboarding Checklist

Before a marketer can start:
1. ✅ Create SuoOps account (with their phone number)
2. ✅ Add bank details in app settings
3. ✅ Get their unique referral code from the app
4. ✅ VA assigns them a Marketer ID (SUO-MKT-001)
5. ✅ VA adds them to Master Roster sheet
6. ✅ (If recruited) Link to their supervisor in sheet

### What Marketers Tell Customers

```
"When you sign up, enter my referral code: [CODE]
You'll get [any referral bonus you offer] and I get credit for helping you!"
```

### Daily Tracking (Optional Backup)

**Marketers CAN still report daily via WhatsApp for visibility:**
```
Daily Report Format:
- Name: [Full Name]
- City: [Lagos/PH/Bayelsa]
- Date: [DD/MM/YYYY]
- Signups Today: [Number]
- Customer Names: [List with phone numbers]
- Proof: [Screenshots of signup confirmation]
```

**Note:** This is now OPTIONAL. The referral dashboard is the source of truth.

## Team Communication & Daily Check-Ins

### WhatsApp Group Structure

```
                    ┌─────────────────┐
                    │   ADMIN / VA    │
                    │  (HQ Group)     │
                    └────────┬────────┘
                             │
          ┌──────────────────┼──────────────────┐
          │                  │                  │
    ┌─────▼─────┐      ┌─────▼─────┐      ┌─────▼─────┐
    │  Lagos    │      │    PH     │      │  Bayelsa  │
    │Supervisor │      │Supervisor │      │Supervisor │
    │  Group    │      │  Group    │      │  Group    │
    └───────────┘      └───────────┘      └───────────┘
```

**Groups to Create:**
1. **SuoOps Field Team - HQ** (VA + All Supervisors only)
2. **SuoOps Lagos Team** (Lagos Supervisor + their marketers)
3. **SuoOps PH Team** (PH Supervisor + their marketers)  
4. **SuoOps Bayelsa Team** (Bayelsa Supervisor + their marketers)

### Daily Check-In (Simple)

**Marketers send to their team group by 8 PM:**
```
📊 [Name] - Day Report
City: Lagos
Today: 3 signups ✅
Week total: 7/10 target
```

**That's it!** No customer details needed - the app tracks everything.

### Supervisor Daily Summary

**Supervisors send to HQ group by 9 PM:**
```
📈 LAGOS TEAM - [Date]
Team Members Active: 8/10
Today's Total: 18 signups
Week Total: 65/100 target

Top Performers Today:
1. John - 5
2. Mary - 4
3. Chidi - 3

Needs Follow-up:
- Peter (0 today)
- Grace (absent)
```

### Why Keep Daily Reports?

Even though the app tracks sales automatically, daily check-ins help with:
- ✅ **Accountability** - Marketers stay focused
- ✅ **Early warning** - Spot struggling team members
- ✅ **Team culture** - Builds camaraderie and competition
- ✅ **Supervisor visibility** - Know what's happening daily

## Supervisor-Marketer Relationships

### How Team Hierarchy is Tracked

The app tracks individual referrals but **doesn't know team structure**.
Use the Google Sheet to track who recruited who.

**Master Roster Example:**

| Marketer ID | Name | Referral Code | Role | Recruited By | Supervisor ID |
|-------------|------|---------------|------|--------------|---------------|
| SUO-SSR-001 | Emeka | REF-EEE001 | Sr. Supervisor | - | - |
| SUO-SUP-001 | Chidi | REF-CCC001 | Supervisor | SUO-SSR-001 | SUO-SSR-001 |
| SUO-MKT-001 | John | REF-JJJ001 | Marketer | SUO-SUP-001 | SUO-SUP-001 |
| SUO-MKT-002 | Mary | REF-MMM001 | Marketer | SUO-SUP-001 | SUO-SUP-001 |
| SUO-MKT-003 | Peter | REF-PPP001 | Marketer | SUO-MKT-001 | SUO-SUP-001 |

**Key Fields:**
- **Recruited By** = Who brought this person in (earns override on their sales)
- **Supervisor ID** = Who they report to daily

**In this example:**
- Emeka (Sr. Supervisor) recruited Chidi
- Chidi (Supervisor) recruited John and Mary
- John recruited Peter (but Peter still reports to Chidi)
- Emeka earns L2 override on Chidi's team
- Chidi earns L1 override on John, Mary, AND Peter

### How Override Flows

```
Customer signs up with Peter's code (REF-PPP001)
Customer goes Pro → ₦5,000 payment
         │
         ├── Peter gets ₦500 (direct commission via app)
         │
         ├── John gets ₦50 (L1 override - he recruited Peter)
         │
         └── Emeka gets ₦25 (L2 override - Chidi's team)
             (Chidi gets nothing extra because HE didn't recruit Peter)
```

**Note:** Override goes to WHO RECRUITED, not just the supervisor.

### When Someone Gets Promoted

**Scenario: John (Marketer) becomes a Supervisor**

1. John recruits 5 active marketers
2. John + team hit targets for 2 weeks
3. VA updates Master Roster:
   - John's Role: `Marketer` → `Supervisor`
   - John gets his own Team ID
4. Chidi (John's recruiter) becomes Sr. Supervisor eligible
5. VA updates Chidi's Role: `Supervisor` → `Sr. Supervisor`

## FAQ

### For Marketers

**Q: How do I become a Supervisor?**
A: Recruit 5 active marketers who each hit their 10/week target for 2 consecutive weeks, while maintaining your own 5/week sales.

**Q: Do I lose my direct commission if I become a Supervisor?**
A: No! You keep earning ₦500 for your own sales PLUS ₦50 for each sale your team makes.

**Q: What if my recruit doesn't perform?**
A: You only earn override on actual sales. If they sell 0, you earn ₦0 override from them. This is why you should recruit motivated people and help them succeed.

**Q: Is there a limit to how many people I can recruit?**
A: No limit, but you only earn override on your DIRECT recruits (L1). If they become Supervisors, you earn L2 override from their teams.

### For Supervisors

**Q: How do I track my team's sales?**
A: The VA will send you a daily team summary. You can also request the weekly sheet at any time.

**Q: What happens if one of my marketers becomes a Supervisor?**
A: Congratulations! You automatically become eligible for L2 status. You'll earn ₦25 for every sale their team makes.

**Q: Can I recruit from other Supervisor's teams?**
A: No. Once a marketer is assigned to a team, they cannot be transferred. You must recruit new people.

### For VA/Admin

**Q: How do I verify sales?**
A: Open SuoOps Admin → Referral Program → Filter by referral code or date. The dashboard is the source of truth.

**Q: What if there's a dispute?**
A: The referral code entered by the customer is recorded in the system. If the code wasn't entered, the sale doesn't count for that marketer.

**Q: How do I calculate complex scenarios?**
A: Use the Commission Calculator tab for stipends and overrides. Direct commissions are handled automatically by the app.

**Q: What if customer forgot to enter referral code?**
A: Unfortunately, that sale won't be credited. Train marketers to ALWAYS ensure the code is entered during signup. They can watch the customer enter it.

```

### Example 2: New Supervisor (5 team members)
```
Own Sales: 8 Pro subscribers
Team Sales: 45 Pro subscribers (combined)

TOTAL: ₦21,250
```

### Example 3: Full Supervisor (10 team members)
```
Own Sales: 10 Pro subscribers

```
Own Sales: 10 Pro subscribers
L1 Team Sales: 100 Pro subscribers
L2 Team Sales: 80 Pro subscribers (sub-supervisor's team)
Direct Commission: 10 × ₦500 = ₦5,000
L1 Override: 100 × ₦50 = ₦5,000
L2 Override: 80 × ₦25 = ₦2,000
Stipend: ₦15,000
