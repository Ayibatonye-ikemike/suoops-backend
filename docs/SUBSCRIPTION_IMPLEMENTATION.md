- **CORS Errors:** Add new Vercel domain to backend config

**Logs to Check:**
```bash
# Backend logs
Render logs --tail --app suoops-backend | grep "subscription"

# Check user plan
render exec python -c "from app.db.session import SessionLocal; from app.models.models import User; db = SessionLocal(); user = db.query(User).filter(User.id == 1).first(); print(f'Plan: {user.plan.value}, Usage: {user.invoices_this_month}')"
