## ðŸŽ¯ Cost Optimization Strategies

### 1. Infrastructure Optimization

### 2. WhatsApp Cost Reduction
- **Batch notifications** instead of sending immediately
- **Use template messages** for common responses (cheaper)
- **Implement retry logic** to avoid duplicate sends

### 4. Payment Processing
- **Encourage bank transfers** over cards (â‚¦50 vs â‚¦850 fee)
- **Negotiate volume discounts** with Paystack (possible at 10,000+ tx/month)
- **Add Flutterwave** as alternative (lower fees in some cases)
- **Pass fees to customers** optionally (transparency++)

### 5. Payroll Cost Reduction
- **Batch payouts weekly** instead of daily (fewer API calls)
- **Use Paystack Bulk Transfer API** (â‚¦50 vs â‚¦100 for individual)
- **Implement retry logic** for failed transfers (avoid double fees)
- **Consider direct bank integration** for large enterprises
