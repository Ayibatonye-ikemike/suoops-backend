## 🎯 Feature Summary

### What It Does
Every invoice PDF now includes a **QR code** at the bottom that customers can scan to:

1. ✅ **Verify Authenticity** - Proves invoice is legitimate
2. ✅ **Check Payment Status** - See if paid/pending
3. ✅ **View Details** - Amount, business name, invoice ID
4. ✅ **Privacy Protected** - Customer names are masked

### How It Works

**1. Invoice Creation**
```
User creates invoice → PDF generated → QR code embedded
```

**2. Customer Verification**
```
Scan QR → Opens verification URL → See invoice details
```

**3. API Response**
```json
{
  "invoice_id": "INV-2025-001",
  "status": "paid",
  "amount": "50000",
  "customer_name": "J***e",  // Masked for privacy
  "business_name": "Your Business Name",
  "authentic": true
}
```

### Security Features
- **No Authentication Required** - Public endpoint for easy verification
- **Customer Name Masking** - Privacy protection ("Jane Doe" → "J***e")
- **Immutable Timestamps** - Tracks when invoice created and verified
- **Fake Invoice Detection** - Returns 404 for non-existent invoices

---

## 📊 Test Results

✅ Render Dynos: web.1 and worker.1 both running
```
