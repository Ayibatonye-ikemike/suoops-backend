# Accreditation Readiness Checklist

> This file supersedes `nrs-registration-checklist.md`. Legacy NRS references have been transitioned to a provisional Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) accreditation framing. External gateway transmission features remain disabled pending formal accreditation.

For full historical context and previously submitted sections, see the archived legacy file (to be removed after downstream link updates).

(Placeholder: Full content migrated in prior file; finalize by removing the old file once references are updated.)
