# WhatsApp Webhook Manual Test

## üéØ Quick Test: Verify Your WhatsApp Bot is Working

### Test 1: Webhook Verification (Meta's GET Request)

```bash
curl -X GET "https://suoops-backend.herokuapp.com/webhooks/whatsapp?hub.mode=subscribe&hub.verify_token=suoops_verify_2025&hub.challenge=test_123"
```

**Expected Response:**
```
test_123
```

‚úÖ **If you see `test_123`**: Webhook verification is working! Meta can connect.

‚ùå **If you see error**: Check webhook endpoint is deployed on Heroku v51.

---

### Test 2: Send Mock WhatsApp Message

**Prerequisites:**
- Have a test business user in database with phone `+2348012345678`
- User must have `phone` field set in their profile

**Run this command:**

```bash
curl -X POST "https://suoops-backend.herokuapp.com/webhooks/whatsapp" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "object": "whatsapp_business_account",
    "entry": [{
      "id": "713163545130337",
      "changes": [{
        "value": {
          "messaging_product": "whatsapp",
          "metadata": {
            "display_phone_number": "15550123456",
            "phone_number_id": "817255254808254"
          },
          "contacts": [{
            "profile": {"name": "Test Business"},
            "wa_id": "2348012345678"
          }],
          "messages": [{
            "from": "2348012345678",
            "id": "wamid.test123",
            "timestamp": "1698432000",
            "text": {
              "body": "Invoice Jane Doe +2348087654321 50000 for logo design"
            },
            "type": "text"
          }]
        },
        "field": "messages"
      }]
    }]
  }'
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{"ok": true, "queued": true}
```

‚úÖ **If you see `"queued": true`**: Message was received and sent to Celery worker!

---

### Test 3: Check Celery Processing

**View logs to see if Celery processed the message:**

```bash
heroku logs --tail --num 100 | grep -E "whatsapp|invoice|celery"
```

**What to look for:**

‚úÖ **Success indicators:**
```
Resolved WhatsApp +2348012345678 ‚Üí User ID 1 (mike@business.com)
Invoice created! Customer: Jane Doe, Amount: ‚Ç¶50,000
```

‚ùå **Error indicators:**
```
Unable to resolve issuer for WhatsApp sender: +2348012345678
‚ö†Ô∏è Please include the customer's phone number
```

---

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Error: "Unable to identify your business account"

**Cause:** Business phone number not registered in database.

**Solution:**
1. Log into your account at suoops.com/dashboard
2. Go to Settings
3. Add your WhatsApp phone number: `+2348012345678`
4. Save
5. Try test again

**OR create test user directly:**

```bash
heroku run python -c "
from app.db.session import SessionLocal
from app.models.models import User
from app.core.security import get_password_hash

db = SessionLocal()
user = User(
    email='test@business.com',
    phone='+2348012345678',
    business_name='Test Business',
    hashed_password=get_password_hash('testpassword123'),
    paystack_secret='sk_test_your_key_here'
)
db.add(user)
db.commit()
print(f'Created user ID: {user.id}')
"
```

---

### Error: "‚ö†Ô∏è Please include the customer's phone number"

**Cause:** Customer phone not found in message text.

**Solution:** Ensure test message includes phone number:
```
Invoice Jane Doe +2348087654321 50000 for logo design
                 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
                 Must include this!
```

---

### No Errors But Nothing Happens

**Check Celery worker is running:**

```bash
heroku ps
```

**Expected output:**
```
=== worker (Celery): celery -A app.workers.worker worker --loglevel=info (1)
worker.1: up 2025/10/23 10:30:00 +0000 (~ 2h ago)
```

**If worker is down, restart it:**

```bash
heroku ps:restart worker
```
