## üéØ Pricing Psychology & Tactics

### 2. **Annual Discount Incentive**
```
Monthly: ‚Ç¶7,500/month = ‚Ç¶90,000/year
Annual: ‚Ç¶75,000/year (save ‚Ç¶15,000!)
```

### 3. **Free Trial Strategy**

### 5. **Comparison to Competitors**
On pricing page:
```
QuickBooks: ‚Ç¶12,000/month

## üéØ Key Success Metrics

### Track These Monthly:
1. **MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue):** Target ‚Ç¶650k by Month 6
2. **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC):** Keep under ‚Ç¶50,000

- ‚ùå Too many Free users (>70%) with low conversion
- ‚ùå Most customers on Starter (low ARPU)

## üö® Contingency Pricing Adjustments

### If Not Enough Upgrades from Free:
- Reduce Free plan to **3 invoices/month** (force upgrade sooner)
- Add "Upgrade to Pro" prompts in WhatsApp bot responses
- Disable voice bot on Free tier (premium feature)

### If Churn is High on Starter:
- Reduce Starter to **‚Ç¶2,000/month** (more affordable)
- Increase limit to **100 invoices/month** (more value)
- Add payment reminders (previously Pro-only)

### If Not Enough Enterprise Customers:
- Create **"Teams" plan** at ‚Ç¶25,000/month (between Business and Enterprise)
- Offer **custom quotes** based on employee count
- Bundle professional services (onboarding, training) for ‚Ç¶100k one-time

### If Competitors Drop Prices:
- We have room to go **down to ‚Ç¶5,000 for Pro** and still profit
- Our costs (‚Ç¶3-8/transaction) allow aggressive pricing
- Voice bot differentiation means we compete on features, not just price
