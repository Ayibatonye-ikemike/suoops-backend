# Payment Link Testing Guide

## üéâ NEW: Payment URL in API Response (Oct 22, 2025)

**The `payment_url` field is now returned in all invoice API responses!**

Example response when creating an invoice:
```json
{
  "invoice_id": "INV-1761133019802-91A9D4",
  "amount": "25000",
  "status": "pending",
  "pdf_url": "file:///app/storage/suoops-storage/invoices/INV-1761133019802-91A9D4.pdf",
  "payment_url": "https://checkout.paystack.com/tispk8kdwhnaqw1",
  "created_at": "2025-10-22T11:36:59.803891Z",
  "due_date": null
}
```

### What Changed:
- ‚úÖ Added `payment_url` column to database
- ‚úÖ Payment URL is now stored when invoice is created
- ‚úÖ Payment URL is returned in API responses (POST /invoices and GET /invoices)
- ‚úÖ Frontend can now display "Pay Now" button directly from API response

## ‚úÖ Payment Link Generation - VERIFIED WORKING!

Your Paystack payment links are automatically generated when invoices are created!

## üîç What We Verified

**Amount**: ‚Ç¶75,000  
**Status**: Pending  
**Created**: October 22, 2025

  "data": {
    "id": 5454437561,
    "domain": "test",
    "status": "abandoned",
    "reference": "INV-1761130244672-C44E59",
    "amount": 7500000,  // Amount in kobo (75000 * 100)
    "currency": "NGN",
    "created_at": "2025-10-22T10:50:44.000Z"
  }
}
```

‚úÖ **Payment link was automatically created when the invoice was generated!**

## üí≥ How Payment Links Work

### 1. Invoice Creation
When an invoice is created (via API or WhatsApp):
```python
# app/services/invoice_service.py
pay_link = self.payment_service.create_payment_link(
    invoice.invoice_id, 
    invoice.amount
)
```

### 2. Paystack API Call
```python
# app/services/payment_providers.py
payload = {
    "reference": "INV-xxx",  # Your invoice ID
    "amount": 7500000,        # Amount in kobo (NGN x 100)
    "email": "customer@example.com",
    "callback_url": "https://suoops.com/payments/confirm"
}
response = requests.post(
    "https://api.paystack.co/transaction/initialize",
    headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {secret}"},
    json=payload
)
```

### 3. Payment Link Returned
Paystack returns:
```json
{
  "status": true,
  "data": {
    "authorization_url": "https://checkout.paystack.com/xxxxx",
    "access_code": "xxxxx",
    "reference": "INV-xxx"
  }
}
```

### 4. Link Embedded in PDF
The payment link is passed to PDF generation:
```python
pdf_url = self.pdf_service.generate_invoice_pdf(
    invoice, 
    payment_url=pay_link  # ‚Üê Embedded in PDF
)
```

## üß™ How to Test Payment Flow

### Option 1: Via Paystack Dashboard (Easiest)

1. Go to [Paystack Dashboard](https://dashboard.paystack.com/)
2. Navigate to **Transactions**
3. Find transaction: `INV-1761130244672-C44E59`
4. Click "View" to see details
5. You'll see the payment page URL

### Option 2: Create New Test Invoice

```bash
# 1. Login
TOKEN=$(curl -s -X POST https://api.suoops.com/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"phone": "+2347012345678", "password": "TestPassword123"}' \
  | python3 -c "import sys, json; print(json.load(sys.stdin)['access_token'])")

# 2. Create invoice
INVOICE=$(curl -s -X POST https://api.suoops.com/invoices \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "customer_name":"Test Payment",
    "customer_phone":"+2348012345678",
    "amount":10000,
    "lines":[{"description":"Test Service","quantity":1,"unit_price":10000}]
  }')

# 3. Get invoice ID
INVOICE_ID=$(echo $INVOICE | python3 -c "import sys, json; print(json.load(sys.stdin)['invoice_id'])")

echo "Invoice ID: $INVOICE_ID"
```

### Option 3: Via Paystack API

```bash
# Get your Paystack secret
SECRET=$(heroku config:get PAYSTACK_SECRET --app suoops-backend)

# Create payment link
curl -X POST https://api.paystack.co/transaction/initialize \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $SECRET" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "reference":"TEST-PAYMENT-001",
    "amount":1000000,
    "email":"test@example.com",
    "callback_url":"https://suoops.com/payments/confirm"
  }'
```

This returns:
```json
{
  "status": true,
  "data": {
    "authorization_url": "https://checkout.paystack.com/xxxxx",
    "access_code": "xxxxx",
    "reference": "TEST-PAYMENT-001"
  }
}
```

Visit the `authorization_url` to complete payment!

## üí∞ Complete a Test Payment

### Paystack Test Cards

Use these test cards in **test mode**:

#### Successful Payment
```
Card Number: 4084084084084081
CVV: 408
Expiry: 12/30
PIN: 1234
OTP: 123456
```

#### Declined Payment
```
Card Number: 5060666666666666666
CVV: 123
Expiry: 12/30
```

### Steps:
1. Create an invoice (via API or WhatsApp)
2. Get the payment link from Paystack dashboard OR generate directly
3. Visit the payment link
4. Enter test card details
5. Complete payment flow
6. Webhook will be triggered automatically
7. Invoice status updates to "paid"

---

## üîî Webhook Flow After Payment

1. **Customer completes payment** on Paystack checkout page
2. **Paystack sends webhook** to `https://api.suoops.com/webhooks/paystack`
3. **Webhook validates signature** (HMAC-SHA512)
4. **Invoice status updated** to "paid" in database
5. **Metrics recorded** (invoice_paid counter)

### Webhook Payload Example
```json
{
  "event": "charge.success",
  "data": {
    "id": 5454437561,
    "reference": "INV-1761130244672-C44E59",
    "amount": 7500000,
    "currency": "NGN",
    "status": "success",
    "customer": {
      "email": "customer@example.com"
    }
  }
}
```

---

## üìä Monitor Payments

### Check Transaction Status
```bash
SECRET=$(heroku config:get PAYSTACK_SECRET --app suoops-backend)
curl -X GET "https://api.paystack.co/transaction/verify/INV-xxx" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $SECRET"
```

### Check Invoice Status in Database
```bash
TOKEN="your_jwt_token"
curl -s https://api.suoops.com/invoices/INV-xxx \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

### View Webhook Events
```bash
curl -s https://api.suoops.com/invoices/INV-xxx/events \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

## üéØ Enhancement Ideas

### 1. Add Payment Link to API Response
Currently, payment links are generated but not returned in the API response. To add this:

1. Add `payment_link` field to `Invoice` model
2. Store the link when creating invoice
3. Return it in `InvoiceOut` schema

### 2. Add "Pay Now" Button to Frontend
Create a button in the invoice list/detail view that:
- Opens Paystack payment page in new window
- Shows payment status
- Refreshes invoice status after payment

### 3. Send Payment Link via WhatsApp
After creating invoice via WhatsApp, send the payment link:
```python
self.client.send_text(
    sender,
    f"Invoice {invoice.invoice_id} created!\nPay here: {payment_link}"
)
```

### 4. Email Invoice with Payment Link
Send professional emails with:
- PDF attachment
- Payment link button
- Invoice details

---

## ‚úÖ Current Status

**Payment integration is FULLY FUNCTIONAL:**
- ‚úÖ Payment links auto-generated on invoice creation
- ‚úÖ Paystack API integration working
