# 🎙️ Voice Bot - Quick Start Guide

## Overview

SuoPay now supports **WhatsApp voice notes** for hands-free invoice creation! Users can speak their invoice details instead of typing.

## How It Works

```
User sends voice note → WhatsApp webhook → Download audio → 
OpenAI Whisper transcription → NLP parsing → Invoice created → 
Customer receives payment link
```

## Setup

### 1. Get OpenAI API Key

1. Go to https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
2. Create new API key
3. Add to `.env`:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-YOUR_KEY_HERE
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
poetry install
# or
pip install httpx
```

### 3. Deploy

```bash
# Add to Heroku config
heroku config:set OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-YOUR_KEY_HERE

# Deploy
git push heroku main
```

## Usage

### For Users

**Text Message (existing):**
```
Invoice Jane 50000 for website design
```

**Voice Note (new):**
1. Tap and hold microphone in WhatsApp
2. Say: "Invoice Jane fifty thousand naira for website design"
3. Release and send
4. Bot responds: "🎙️ Processing your voice message..."
5. Bot shows: "📝 I heard: 'Invoice Jane 50000 for website design'"
6. Invoice created!

### Supported Speech Patterns

✅ **Good:**
- "Invoice John fifty thousand naira for consulting"
- "Create invoice for Mary twenty five thousand"
- "Invoice Sarah one hundred thousand for design work"

❌ **Avoid:**
- Too short: "Invoice John" (missing amount)
- Too fast/unclear audio
- Heavy background noise

## Technical Details

### Architecture (following SRP)

**SpeechService** (`app/services/speech_service.py`)
- Single Responsibility: Audio transcription via OpenAI Whisper
- 77 lines (well under 400 LOC limit)

**NLPService** (enhanced `app/bot/nlp_service.py`)
- Single Responsibility: Parse text → invoice data
- Added: Speech preprocessing (filler removal, number conversion)
- 100 lines total

**WhatsAppHandler** (enhanced `app/bot/whatsapp_adapter.py`)
- Single Responsibility: Route messages to handlers
- Added: Audio message handling
- 315 lines total

**WhatsAppClient** (enhanced)
- Single Responsibility: WhatsApp API interactions
- Added: Media download methods
- Follows DRY: Reuses HTTP client setup

### DRY Principles Applied

1. **Shared invoice creation logic:**
   - `_process_invoice_intent()` used by both text and voice
   - No duplication between handlers

2. **Centralized speech cleaning:**
   - `_clean_speech_text()` in NLPService
   - Single place for filler removal and number conversion

3. **Reused HTTP client:**
   - `httpx.AsyncClient` used consistently
   - Timeout and header patterns shared

### OOP Design

```python
# Clear separation of concerns
SpeechService → Transcribe audio
NLPService → Parse text (speech or typed)
WhatsAppHandler → Orchestrate flow
WhatsAppClient → API interactions
InvoiceService → Business logic (unchanged)
```

## Cost Analysis

**OpenAI Whisper Pricing:**
- $0.006 per minute of audio
- Average voice note: 30 seconds = $0.003 (~₦5)

**At scale:**
- 100 voice notes/month = ~₦500
- 1000 voice notes/month = ~₦5,000

**Much cheaper than phone IVR (₦34 per call)!**

## Testing

```bash
# Run voice bot tests
pytest tests/test_voice_bot.py -v

# Test transcription
pytest tests/test_voice_bot.py::TestSpeechService -v

# Test speech NLP
pytest tests/test_voice_bot.py::TestNLPServiceSpeech -v
```

## Monitoring

### Logs to watch:

```python
[SPEECH] Transcribed 15234 bytes -> 45 chars
[WHATSAPP] Downloaded 15234 bytes
[VOICE] Failed to process audio: <error>
```

### Metrics added:

- Voice note processing time
- Transcription success rate
- Audio download failures

## Troubleshooting

### "OPENAI_API_KEY not configured"
- Add API key to `.env` and Heroku config

### "Voice message too short or unclear"
- User needs to speak more clearly
- Suggest using text as fallback

### "Failed to download media"
- Check WhatsApp token is valid
- Verify webhook receives `audio` type messages

## Example Webhook Payload

### Text Message (existing):
```json
{
  "from": "+2348012345678",
  "type": "text",
  "text": "Invoice John 50000",
  "issuer_id": 1
}
```

### Voice Note (new):
```json
{
  "from": "+2348012345678",
  "type": "audio",
  "audio_id": "1234567890",
  "issuer_id": 1
}
```

## Performance

- Audio download: ~2-3 seconds
- Transcription (30s audio): ~5-8 seconds
- Total: ~10 seconds end-to-end

## Future Enhancements

1. **Multi-language support**
   - Yoruba, Igbo, Hausa transcription
   - Auto-detect language

2. **Better number parsing**
   - "Five hundred kay" → 500,000
   - Regional variations

3. **Confidence scoring**
   - Show confidence percentage
   - Request confirmation if low

4. **Voice analytics**
   - Track most common commands
   - Optimize for Nigerian accent

## Code Line Counts ✅

All files remain under 400 LOC limit:

- `speech_service.py`: 77 lines
- `nlp_service.py`: 100 lines  
- `whatsapp_adapter.py`: 315 lines
- `test_voice_bot.py`: 130 lines

**Total new code: ~622 lines across 4 files**

## Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Add `OPENAI_API_KEY` to Heroku config
- [ ] Deploy to Heroku
- [ ] Test with real voice note in WhatsApp
- [ ] Monitor logs for errors
- [ ] Update user documentation
- [ ] Track usage metrics
