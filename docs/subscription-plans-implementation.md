# Subscription Plans Implementation Summary üéØ

**Date:** October 22, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Implemented, Ready for Migration & Deployment

---

## Overview

Implemented subscription-based invoice limits to ensure profitability and prevent scenarios like customers paying ‚Ç¶2,500/month for 1,000 invoices (which would cost us ‚Ç¶4,566).

---

## Subscription Tiers

| Plan | Price | Invoice Limit | Target Customer | Profit Margin |
|------|-------|---------------|----------------|---------------|
| **FREE** | ‚Ç¶0 | 5/month | Testers, freelancers | Loss leader |
| **STARTER** | ‚Ç¶2,500 | 100/month | Freelancers, solopreneurs | 39% |
| **PRO** | ‚Ç¶7,500 | 1,000/month | SMBs (5-20 employees) | 50% |
| **BUSINESS** | ‚Ç¶15,000 | 3,000/month | Medium businesses | 30% |
| **ENTERPRISE** | ‚Ç¶50,000+ | Unlimited | Large corporations | 84% |

### Cost Justification Examples:

**Scenario 1: Free tier (5 invoices)**
- Cost: ‚Ç¶15 (5 √ó ‚Ç¶3)
- Revenue: ‚Ç¶0
- Purpose: Customer acquisition, conversion to paid

**Scenario 2: Starter (100 invoices)**
- Cost: ‚Ç¶1,524 (infrastructure share + 100 √ó ‚Ç¶3)
- Revenue: ‚Ç¶2,500
- **Profit: ‚Ç¶976 (39%)**

**Scenario 3: Pro (1,000 invoices)**
- Cost: ‚Ç¶3,783 (infrastructure share + 1,000 √ó ‚Ç¶3)
- Revenue: ‚Ç¶7,500
- **Profit: ‚Ç¶3,717 (50%)**

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Database Schema (Migration 0005)

#### New Enum Type:
```sql
CREATE TYPE subscriptionplan AS ENUM (
    'free', 'starter', 'pro', 'business', 'enterprise'
)
```

#### New User Columns:
- `plan` (subscriptionplan, default='free'): Current subscription tier
- `invoices_this_month` (integer, default=0): Usage counter
- `usage_reset_at` (timestamp): Last reset date for monthly cycle

### 2. Model Changes (`app/models/models.py`)

#### SubscriptionPlan Enum:
```python
class SubscriptionPlan(str, enum.Enum):
    FREE = "free"
    STARTER = "starter"
    PRO = "pro"
    BUSINESS = "business"
    ENTERPRISE = "enterprise"
    
    @property
    def invoice_limit(self) -> int | None:
        """Returns monthly limit (None = unlimited)"""
    
    @property
    def price(self) -> int:
        """Returns monthly price in Naira"""
```

#### Updated User Model:
- Added `plan`, `invoices_this_month`, `usage_reset_at` fields
- Automatic tracking of subscription status

### 3. Service Logic (`app/services/invoice_service.py`)

#### New Methods:

**`check_invoice_quota(issuer_id)`**
- Checks if user can create more invoices
- Auto-resets usage on new month
- Returns quota status with upgrade messages

**`_reset_usage_if_needed(user)`**
- Resets counter on 1st of each month
- Automatic, runs on every quota check

**`_get_upgrade_message(plan)`**
- Returns plan-specific upgrade prompt
- Example: "Upgrade to Pro (‚Ç¶7,500/month) for 1,000 invoices!"

#### Updated `create_invoice()`:
- Checks quota before creating
- Raises HTTPException 403 if limit reached
- Increments usage counter on success
- Logs usage: "Created invoice INV-123 (usage: 95/100)"

### 4. WhatsApp Bot Updates (`app/bot/whatsapp_adapter.py`)

#### Quota Enforcement:
- Checks quota before processing invoice intent
- Shows warning when approaching limit (5 or fewer remaining)
- Blocks creation with upgrade prompt when at limit
- Handles 403 errors gracefully with user-friendly message

#### Example Messages:

**Warning (5 left):**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Only 5 invoices left! 
Upgrade to Pro (‚Ç¶7,500/month) for 1,000 invoices!
```

**Limit Reached:**
```
üö´ Invoice Limit Reached!

Plan: STARTER
Used: 100/100 invoices this month

Upgrade to Pro (‚Ç¶7,500/month) for 1,000 invoices!

üìû Contact us to upgrade your plan.
```

## User Flow

### 1. New User Signup
- Automatically assigned FREE plan (5 invoices/month)
- Can create 5 invoices immediately
- Usage counter starts at 0

### 2. Creating Invoices
1. User sends "Invoice Jane 50000 for logo" via WhatsApp
2. Bot checks `check_invoice_quota(user_id)`
3. If quota OK:
   - Create invoice
   - Increment `invoices_this_month`
   - If 5 or fewer remaining, show warning
4. If at limit:
   - Block creation
   - Show upgrade prompt with pricing

### 3. Monthly Reset
- Runs automatically on first quota check of new month
- Resets `invoices_this_month` to 0
- Updates `usage_reset_at` to current timestamp
- Logged: "Reset invoice usage for user 123 (new month)"

### 4. Plan Upgrades (Future)
- User contacts sales or upgrades via dashboard
- Admin updates `user.plan` to new tier
- Immediately gets new invoice limit
- No need to wait for next month

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Run Migration (LOCAL FIRST)
```bash
# Test migration locally
alembic upgrade head

# Verify columns added
psql -d suopay_local -c "\d+ user"
```

### 2. Run Migration (HEROKU)
```bash
# Push code to Heroku
git push heroku main

# Run migration in production
heroku run alembic upgrade head -a suoops-backend

# Verify migration
heroku pg:psql -a suoops-backend
\d+ user
```

### 3. Verify Production
```bash
# Check logs
heroku logs --tail -a suoops-backend

# Test with existing user
curl -X POST https://api.suoops.com/invoices \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -d '{"customer_name":"Test","amount":1000}'

# Should increment invoices_this_month
```

### 4. Backfill Existing Users
```sql
-- All existing users get FREE plan (already default)
-- No backfill needed, but verify:
SELECT id, name, plan, invoices_this_month FROM "user" LIMIT 10;
```

---

## Monitoring & Alerts

### Metrics to Track:
1. **Conversion Rate:** Free ‚Üí Starter upgrades
   - Target: 10-15% conversion after hitting limit
2. **Churn Risk:** Users hitting limit multiple times without upgrading
   - Alert: User hits limit 3 times in a row
3. **Usage Patterns:** Average invoices per plan
   - Ensure limits match real usage
4. **Revenue Impact:** Upgrades triggered by limits
   - Track which limits drive most upgrades

### Dashboard Queries:
```sql
-- Users by plan
SELECT plan, COUNT(*) FROM "user" GROUP BY plan;

-- Users approaching limit
SELECT id, name, plan, invoices_this_month 
FROM "user" 
WHERE invoices_this_month >= (
    CASE plan
        WHEN 'free' THEN 4
        WHEN 'starter' THEN 95
        WHEN 'pro' THEN 950
        WHEN 'business' THEN 2900
        ELSE 999999
    END
);

-- Users who hit limit this month
SELECT u.id, u.name, u.plan, COUNT(i.id) as invoice_count
FROM "user" u
JOIN invoice i ON i.issuer_id = u.id
WHERE i.created_at >= DATE_TRUNC('month', CURRENT_DATE)
GROUP BY u.id, u.name, u.plan
HAVING COUNT(i.id) >= (
    CASE u.plan
        WHEN 'free' THEN 5
        WHEN 'starter' THEN 100
        WHEN 'pro' THEN 1000
        WHEN 'business' THEN 3000
        ELSE 999999
    END
);
```

## Revenue Impact Analysis

### Before Limits (UNPROFITABLE):
**Scenario:** 50 Starter customers at ‚Ç¶2,500/month, each creating 1,000 invoices
- Revenue: 50 √ó ‚Ç¶2,500 = ‚Ç¶125,000
- Costs: ‚Ç¶78,325 + (50 √ó 1,000 √ó ‚Ç¶3) = ‚Ç¶228,325
- **LOSS: -‚Ç¶103,325/month** ‚ùå

### After Limits (PROFITABLE):
**Scenario:** Same 50 customers, forced to upgrade to Pro for 1,000 invoices
- Revenue: 50 √ó ‚Ç¶7,500 = ‚Ç¶375,000
- Costs: ‚Ç¶78,325 + (50 √ó 1,000 √ó ‚Ç¶3) = ‚Ç¶228,325
- **PROFIT: ‚Ç¶146,675/month (39% margin)** ‚úÖ
- **Annual profit: ‚Ç¶1,760,100** üöÄ

### Realistic Mixed Scenario (Year 1):
- 100 FREE users: ‚Ç¶0 revenue, ‚Ç¶1,500 cost (loss leader)
- 30 STARTER (avg 50 invoices): ‚Ç¶75,000 revenue, ‚Ç¶45,720 cost
- 25 PRO (avg 500 invoices): ‚Ç¶187,500 revenue, ‚Ç¶94,575 cost
- 10 BUSINESS (avg 2,000 invoices): ‚Ç¶150,000 revenue, ‚Ç¶75,670 cost
- 2 ENTERPRISE (avg 5,000 invoices): ‚Ç¶100,000 revenue, ‚Ç¶45,666 cost

**Total:**
- Revenue: ‚Ç¶512,500/month
- Costs: ‚Ç¶263,131/month
- **Profit: ‚Ç¶249,369/month (49% margin)** ‚úÖ
- **Annual profit: ‚Ç¶2,992,428** üéâ

## Support Playbook

### Customer: "I can't create invoices!"

**Response:**
1. Check their plan: `SELECT plan, invoices_this_month FROM "user" WHERE id = X`
2. If at limit: "You've used all X invoices on your [PLAN] plan this month"
3. Offer upgrade: "Upgrade to [NEXT_PLAN] for [LIMIT] invoices at ‚Ç¶[PRICE]/month"
4. Process upgrade if customer agrees

### Customer: "Why do I need to upgrade?"

**Response:**
"Our pricing is based on usage to keep costs fair. Your [CURRENT_PLAN] plan includes [LIMIT] invoices/month for ‚Ç¶[PRICE]. For more invoices, we offer [NEXT_PLAN] with [NEXT_LIMIT] invoices at ‚Ç¶[NEXT_PRICE]/month - that's only ‚Ç¶[COST_PER_INVOICE] per invoice!"

### Customer: "Can I get a refund?"

**Response:**
"Plans are monthly and usage resets on the 1st. If you're consistently under your limit, we can help you downgrade to a plan that better fits your needs."
