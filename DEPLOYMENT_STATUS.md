## 🔍 What to Test After Deployment

### Quick Verification

```bash
# Check health
curl https://api.suoops.com/healthz

### 2. Verify OpenAI Key is Set
```bash
heroku config:get OPENAI_API_KEY
```

### 3. Check Logs
```bash
heroku logs --tail
```

### 4. Test Voice Note (Manual)
1. Send voice note to your WhatsApp Business number
2. Say: "Invoice John fifty thousand naira for consulting"
3. Expected response:
   - "🎙️ Processing your voice message..."
   - "📝 I heard: 'Invoice John 50000 naira for consulting'"
   - "✅ Invoice INV-XXX created!"

---

## 📊 Expected Performance

- **Audio download**: 2-3 seconds
- **Transcription**: 5-8 seconds (30s audio)
- **Invoice creation**: 1-2 seconds
- **Total**: ~10 seconds end-to-end

---

## 💰 Cost Monitoring

### OpenAI Whisper Pricing
- $0.006 per minute of audio
- 30-second voice note = $0.003 (~₦5)
- 1000 voice notes/month = ~₦5,000

### How to Monitor Usage
1. Go to: https://platform.openai.com/usage
2. Check "Audio" usage
3. Track costs daily

---

## 🔐 Security Notes

✅ **API Key Secured:**
- Not committed to git (in `.gitignore`)
- Stored in Heroku config vars (encrypted)
- Local `.env` file should not be shared

⚠️ **Important:**
- Don't share the API key in messages/docs
- Rotate key if accidentally exposed
- Monitor usage for unauthorized access

---

## 🎯 Success Criteria

After deployment completes, verify:

- [ ] Health endpoint responds
- [ ] Heroku app running (v32 or higher)
- [ ] No errors in logs
- [ ] Can send text message (existing feature still works)
- [ ] Can send voice note (new feature works)
- [ ] Invoice created from voice note
- [ ] Customer receives payment link

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If deployment fails:
```bash
heroku logs --tail
heroku ps
heroku releases
```

### If voice notes don't work:
1. Check OpenAI key is set: `heroku config:get OPENAI_API_KEY`
2. Check logs for errors: `heroku logs --tail | grep SPEECH`
3. Verify WhatsApp webhook receives audio messages
4. Test with curl if needed

### Common Issues:

**"OPENAI_API_KEY not configured"**
- Run: `heroku config:set OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-svcacct-...`

**"Failed to download media"**
- Check WhatsApp access token is valid
- Verify webhook permissions

**"Transcription failed"**
- Check OpenAI API key permissions
- Verify audio format is supported

## 📈 Next Steps After Deployment

1. **Test thoroughly** with real voice notes
2. **Monitor costs** on OpenAI dashboard
3. **Track metrics**:
   - Voice notes processed
   - Transcription success rate
   - Average processing time
4. **Update user documentation**
5. **Announce feature** to users
